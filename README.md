Toumei is a feature visualization<sup>1</sup> library for pytorch providing a pipeline like work-flow for defining and optimizing custom objective functions. It implements every main idea presented in the distill articles and provides a user friendly interface for analyzing models.

There are multiple parameterization approaches currently implemented in toumei:
- pixel based image parameterization
- fast fourier transformation based parameterization
- ~~neural net based parameterization~~ (WIP)
- ~~GAN based parameterization~~<sup>2</sup> (WIP)

# Quick start
```python
# the model we want to inspect
alexNet = models.alexnet(pretrained=True)

# list the modules of the model
probe.print_modules(alexNet)

# build a pipeline
objective = Pipeline(
    # the image generator object
    param.Transform(param.PixelImage(1, 3, 512, 512)),

    # the objective function
    obj.Channel("features.8:12")
)

# attach the objective to the model
objective.attach(alexNet)

# optimize the objective
objective.optimize()

```
