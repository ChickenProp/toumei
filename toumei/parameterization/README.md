## Parameterization (TODO)

This subpackage contains classes for the parameterization of images. Feature Visualization through optimization has been
found to work better with parameterized images, than with just plain pixel based images.
Toumei implements a couple of approaches:
- Simple Pixel Images
- Fast Fourier Transformation Images
- Neural Network based Images
- Generative Adversarial Network based Images (Generator)
